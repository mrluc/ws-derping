1. Startup script?
  - prep assets (coffee, scss)
  - launch server
  
2. Ensure that libs load on client
  - Box2d
  
3. Some kind of output/drawing
  - ghetto canvas output?
  - css3d seems to be very fast
  - We could make each entity a canvas,
    additively, and still use DOM + CSS3d for
    the archi - just getting some fancy effects
    on browsers that support canvas, like 
    bump/spec/etc.
